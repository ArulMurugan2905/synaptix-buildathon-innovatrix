# Pathway Execution Overview

Pathway is used as the stateful execution layer for the system.
It enables streaming ingestion, persistent memory, and deterministic
decision enforcement across continuous event flows.

# Future Implementation Plan

Planned implementation includes:
- Pathway pipelines for policy ingestion
- Stateful rule evaluation logic
- Event-driven transaction enforcement
- Integration with agent frameworks

This will be developed in the finals stage.
