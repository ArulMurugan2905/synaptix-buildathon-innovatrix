# Agent Flow

The system uses decoupled agents operating in an event-driven sequence:

1. Policy Listener Agent
2. Policy-to-Rule Interpreter
3. Memory Synchronization Agent
4. Transaction Monitoring Agent
5. Enforcement & Decision Agent
6. Audit & Explainability Agent

Agents communicate via state updates rather than direct prompt chaining.
