# System Architecture

The system is composed of four primary layers:

1. Input & Event Sources
2. Interpretation Layer (LLM-assisted)
3. State & Memory Engine (Pathway)
4. Decision Enforcement Layer

Pathway acts as the execution engine, maintaining persistent system state
and enabling incremental updates as new events arrive.
